## ‚ú® Vision

In a world of diverse learning needs, one-size-fits-all education falls short. LearnBuddy was created to change that. We envision a future where every child, regardless of their physical, sensory, or cognitive abilities, has free access to a personal AI tutor that understands their pace, adapts to their style, and makes learning a joyful adventure.

This is a community-driven project. We believe that by working together, we can build a powerful, free alternative to commercial learning platforms.
